# classifier_CIFAR10

A classifier based on CIFAR10 dataset written in pytorch.

This repository is alos a great way to familarise oneseelf with pytorch syntax and grow.

## Procedure
*Load data using "data loaders" and normalize
*Create and compile network
*train network with data

*test network with test data

## Results:
A fairly descent classifier just as good as guessing
